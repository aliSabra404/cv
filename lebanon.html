    <h1>Lebanon</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Lebanon, country located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. It consists of a narrow strip of
            territory and is one of the world’s smaller sovereign states. The capital is Beirut. <br> <br>

            Lebanon
            Lebanon
            Though Lebanon, particularly its coastal region, was the site of some of the oldest human settlements in the
            world—the Phoenician ports of Tyre (modern Ṣūr), Sidon (Ṣaydā), and Byblos (Jubayl) were dominant centres of
            trade and culture in the 3rd millennium BCE—it was not until 1920 that the contemporary state came into
            being. In that year France, which administered Lebanon as a League of Nations mandate, established the state
            of Greater Lebanon. Lebanon then became a republic in 1926 and achieved independence in 1943. <br> <br>

            Lebanon shares many of the cultural characteristics of the Arab world, yet it has attributes that
            differentiate it from many of its Arab neighbours. Its rugged, mountainous terrain has served throughout
            history as an asylum for diverse religious and ethnic groups and for political dissidents. Lebanon is one of
            the most densely populated countries in the Mediterranean area and has a high rate of literacy.
            Notwithstanding its meagre natural resources, Lebanon long managed to serve as a busy commercial and
            cultural centre for the Middle East. <br> <br>

            This outward image of vitality and growth nevertheless disguised serious problems. Not only did Lebanon have
            to grapple with internal problems of social and economic organization, but it also had to struggle to define
            its position in relation to Israel, to its Arab neighbours, and to Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon.
            The delicate balance of Lebanese confessionalism (the proportional sharing of power between the country’s
            religious communities) was eroded under the pressures of this struggle; communal rivalries over political
            power, exacerbated by the complex issues that arose from the question of Palestinian presence and from a
            growing “state within a state,” led to the outbreak of an extremely damaging civil war in 1975 and a
            breakdown of the governmental system. After the end of the civil war in 1990, Lebanon gradually reclaimed a
            degree of relative socioeconomic and political stability; because of the continued problems of external
            intervention and troubled confessional relations, however, many of Lebanon’s challenges persisted into the
            early 21st century.</li>

    <h1><em> Relief</em></h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            As in any mountainous region, the physical geography of Lebanon is extremely complex and varied. Landforms,
            climate, soils, and vegetation undergo some sharp and striking changes within short distances. Four distinct
            physiographic regions may be distinguished: a narrow coastal plain along the Mediterranean Sea, the Lebanon
            Mountains (Jabal Lubnān), Al-Biqāʿ (Bekaa) valley, and the Anti-Lebanon and Hermon ranges running parallel
            to
            the Lebanese Mountains.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h1><em> Economy of Lebanon </em></h1>
        <li>
            Geopolitical factors in recent decades have placed significant strain on the economy of Lebanon, which had
            enjoyed status as a regional and commercial centre. The Lebanese economy was characterized by a minimum of
            government intervention in private enterprise combined with an income- and profit-tax-free environment.
            Although imports far outstripped exports, elements such as tourism and remittances from labourers working
            abroad helped balance the trade deficit. Income was generally on the rise, and Lebanese products were
            finding a place on the international market. <br> <br>
            A long-lasting civil war (1975–90) created long-term consequences for the economy. For the first 10 years of
            the civil war, the Lebanese economy proved remarkably resilient; after the mid-1980s, however, the value of
            the Lebanese pound plummeted as the continued destruction of the country’s infrastructure took its toll.
            After the civil war, Lebanon embarked on an ambitious program of social and economic reconstruction that
            entailed extensive renovation of the country’s flagging infrastructure. Initiated by Prime Minister Rafic
            al-Hariri in the 1990s, it aimed to revive Beirut as a regional financial and commercial centre. Beirut’s
            reconstruction program made considerable progress in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, albeit at the
            expense of an increasing internal and external governmental debt load: much of the rebuilding program was
            financed through internal borrowing, which led to the emergence of both budget deficits and a growing public
            debt. Yet, to attract and encourage investment, tax rates were reduced. This led to severe budgetary
            austerity, resulting in only limited investment in Lebanon’s social infrastructure and a growing reliance on
            regressive indirect taxation to meet budgetary shortfalls. Hence, while a fraction of Lebanese became very
            rich in postwar Lebanon, at the beginning of the 21st century some one-third of the Lebanese population
            lived below the poverty line. <br> <br>
            Despite Lebanon’s uneasy economic recovery, its economy remained resilient in the face of the 2008 global
            economic recession. Increased domestic security contributed to investment and growth, while its small export
            base insulated the economy from the global downturn. From 2007 to 10, gross domestic product (GDP) growth
            averaged 8 percent. <br> <br>
            Lebanon’s fortunes turned in 2011, however, with the uprising in Syria and the subsequent civil war there.
            With Lebanon dependent on Syria’s economy and also having to deal with a massive influx of refugees, GDP
            growth in Lebanon slowed to less than 2 percent from 2011 to 2017. In 2018 a financial crisis loomed as the
            debt-to-GDP ratio exceeded 150 percent. Political wrangling and corruption, belt-tightening austerity
            measures, and the inability of the government to address crises contributed to a substantial loss in
            consumer and investor confidence, eventually culminating in October 2019 with massive demonstrations
            countrywide.

                <h1><em>Religion</em></h1>
                <li> Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Lebanon’s social structure is its varied religious
                    composition.
                    Since the 7th century, Lebanon has served as a refuge for persecuted Christian and Muslim groups. As
                    religion and government in Lebanon are deeply and formally intertwined, the relative proportions of
                    the
                    country’s religious communities is a highly sensitive matter. There has not been an official census
                    since 1932, however, and the data depicting Lebanon’s confessional composition are variable. In
                    general
                    terms, the two largest groups are the Shiʿi Muslims and the Sunni Muslims, each comprising more than
                    one-fourth of the population. Maronites, a Roman Catholic Eastern rite group that originated in the
                    region, make up more than one-fifth of the population. A number of other Christian communities are
                    also
                    present, including the Greek Orthodox and the Greek Catholics. The Druze constitute a small
                    percentage
                    of the population but play an influential role in Lebanese society. There is also a very small
                    Jewish
                    minority.</li>

                <li>
                    Lebanon was heavily forested in ancient and medieval times, and its timber—particularly its famed
                    cedar—was exported for building and shipbuilding. The natural vegetation, however, has been grazed,
                    burned, and cut for so long that little of it is regenerated. What survives is a wild Mediterranean
                    vegetation of brush and low trees, mostly oaks, pines, cypresses, firs, junipers, and carobs. <br>
                    <br>
                    Few large wild animals survive in Lebanon, though bears are occasionally seen in the mountains.
                    Among the smaller animals, deer, wildcats, hedgehogs, squirrels, martens, dormice, and hares are
                    found. Numerous migratory birds from Africa and Europe visit Lebanon. Flamingos, pelicans,
                    cormorants, ducks, herons, and snipes frequent the marshes; eagles, buzzards, kites, falcons, and
                    hawks inhabit the mountains; and owls, kingfishers, cuckoos, and woodpeckers are common. <br> <br>
                    Although Lebanon’s diverse and abundant plant and animal life suffered a heavy toll during the
                    country’s lengthy civil war and subsequent conflicts, the post-civil war period was marked by the
                    rise of fledgling environmental groups and movements that worked toward the creation of protected
                    areas and parks in Lebanon’s sensitive ecological areas.

        <h1><em>Manufacturing</em></h1>
        <li>
            Leading industries in Lebanon include the manufacture of food products; cement, bricks, and ceramics; wood
            and wood products; and textiles. Many of the country’s industries were harmed by the civil war, and its
            effects on the textile industry were especially severe. Although some of the country’s large complexes were
            unharmed, Beirut’s industrial belt was razed; in addition, Israel’s occupation of the Lebanese south led to
            an influx of Israeli goods that also harmed Lebanese industries. The construction industry has fuelled much
            of the postwar economy, though it frequently experienced downturns because of recurrent damage to
            infrastructure in the early 21st century and regional instability in the 2010s.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h1> <em> Services </em></h1>
        <li>
            Before Lebanon’s civil war, the growth of the service sector—which generated the overwhelming proportion of
            national income and employed the largest proportion of the labour force—was related mainly to international
            transport and trade and to the position of Beirut as a centre of international banking and tourism. The
            abundance of natural scenery, historic sites, hotels, bars, nightclubs, restaurants, seaside and mountain
            resorts, outdoor sports facilities, and international cultural festivals in Lebanon traditionally helped
            maintain tourism as one of the country’s most important year-round industries. <br> <br>
            Although all economic sectors were affected by the warfare, the detriment to the service sector was among
            the most profound. Following the end of the civil war in 1990, extensive reconstruction programs aimed to
            return Beirut to its status as a hub of finance and tourism, although progress was disrupted by periods of
            ongoing violence in Lebanon and the region in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
