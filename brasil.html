                <li> The country of Brazil occupies roughly half of South America, bordering the Atlantic Ocean. Brazil
                    covers a total area of 8,514,215 km2 (3,287,357 sq mi) which includes 8,456,510 km2 (3,265,080 sq
                    mi) of
                    land and 55,455 km2 (21,411 sq mi) of water. <br> <br>
                    The Brazilian landscape is immense and complex, with interspersed rivers, wetlands, mountains, and
                    plateaus adjoining other major features and traversing the boundaries of states and regions.

        <h1><em>Relief</em></h1>
        <li>
            Brazil is a predominantly tropical country famous for its extensive Amazon lowlands; however, highlands
            cover most of the national territory. Brazil’s physical features can be grouped into five main
            physiographic divisions: the Guiana Highlands in the North, the Amazon lowlands, the Pantanal in the
            Central-West, the Brazilian Highlands (including the extensive coastal ranges), and the coastal
            lowlands.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h1><em>The economy of Brazil</em></h1>
        <li>Brazil is one of the world giants of mining, agriculture, and manufacturing, and it has a strong and rapidly
            growing service sector. It is a leading producer of a host of minerals, including iron ore, tin, bauxite
            (the ore of aluminum), manganese, gold, quartz, and diamonds and other gems, and it exports vast quantities
            of steel, automobiles, electronics, and consumer goods. Brazil is the world’s primary source of coffee,
            oranges, and cassava (manioc) and a major producer of sugar, soy, and beef; however, the relative importance
            of Brazilian agriculture has been declining since the mid-20th century when the country began to rapidly
            urbanize and exploit its mineral, industrial, and hydroelectric potential. The city of São Paulo, in
            particular, has become one of the world’s major industrial and commercial centres. <br> <br>
            Brazil’s economic history can be largely characterized as a cycle of booms and busts. From the 16th to the
            mid-20th century, the country was heavily dependent on one or two major agricultural products, whose prices
            fluctuated widely on international markets. The cyclical aspect of the economy began with the export of
            brazilwood in early colonial times and continued with a sugar boom, a mineral boom in the 18th century
            (paced especially by gold and diamond mining), a coffee boom from the mid-19th century, and a rubber boom in
            the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Brazilian government in the 20th century attempted to diversify
            the country’s production and reduce its dependency on agricultural exports by strongly encouraging
            manufacturing. <br> <br>
            The government, hoping to ensure domestic control of key industries, spearheaded a host of nationalistic
            policies following the Great Depression of the 1930s. It took ownership of some of the country’s largest
            companies, usually in partnership with one or more local or foreign corporations, and subsequently sold
            stock to private investors. The government’s growing involvement in the industrial sector was criticized for
            promoting political and social objectives rather than economic ones and for its cumbersome and inefficient
            bureaucracy; however, some industries attributed their successes to government measures, which included
            direct investments, tax and other incentives, protective tariffs, and import restrictions. The government
            initiated several key industries, including a modern shipbuilding program, a petrochemical sector led by the
            huge Petrobrás company (created in 1953), a burgeoning microelectronics and personal computer industry, and
            aircraft manufacturing by the Embraer corporation, including commercial jetliners, aviation and surveillance
            equipment, and aircraft for the Brazilian air force. It established a motor vehicle industry in the 1950s to
            replace U.S. and German imports and assembly plants. For a period during the late 20th century,
            manufacturing accounted for the largest segment of the gross domestic product (GDP) before it was overtaken
            by the service sector. <br><br>
            Almost continuously high rates of inflation in the late 20th century affected every aspect of Brazil’s
            economic life. Inflation came in part from the government’s policies of deficit spending, heavily financing
            industrial expansion, and subsidizing business loans, as well as the practice among individual Brazilians of
            obtaining loans from foreign banks when domestic credit was restricted. In the latter part of the 20th
            century, Brazil indexed nearly all transactions for inflation, according to the constantly corrected value
            of the government’s bonds. This practice virtually institutionalized inflation and led to public acceptance
            of its inevitability. As a result, Brazil’s anti-inflation programs were only fleetingly successful until
            the mid-1990s, when the government initiated the Real Plan (Plano Real), a program that strictly limited
            government spending, introduced a new currency, and made other fiscal reforms. <br> <br>
            The government privatized dozens of financial institutions, manufacturers, and mining companies in the
            1990s, including several major steel producers and the Rio Doce Valley Company (Companhia Vale do Rio Dôce;
            CVRD). The CVRD, Brazil’s giant mining and shipping conglomerate, was apportioned into separate (but still
            economically formidable) mining and shipping units. The government also sold a minority of its Petrobrás
            shares to private investors and partially opened the petroleum industry to competition. Additional public
            offerings of Petrobrás shares followed—in 2010, notably, the company raised about $70 billion in the world’s
            largest share offering to date—but the government retained its majority ownership. <br><br>
            At the beginning of the 21st century, serious problems marked the Brazilian economy, aggravated by political
            uncertainties. Inflation, financial instability, and unemployment (or underemployment) remained constant
            threats, and political and financial scandals periodically erupted throughout the country. However, by
            mid-2004 the inflation rate had decreased, and for the first time Brazil issued bonds in its own currency,
            the real, instead of the dollar. Brazil still has one of the world’s most lopsided distributions of wealth:
            10 percent of the people received nearly half of the country’s income, whereas the poorest 40 percent of the
            population brought in less than one-tenth of the total. In addition, patterns of landownership continued to
            be grossly uneven, as they were in colonial times, and social movements agitated for reforms.

                <h1><em>Religion</em> </h1>
                <li> About two-thirds of the Brazilian people adhere to Roman Catholicism, which ceased to be the
                    official
                    religion after the proclamation of the republic in 1889. After independence, which loosed the
                    formerly
                    close links between church and state, the predominance of Catholics among the immigrants of the 19th
                    and
                    20th centuries contributed to the lasting presence of that religion. Much of the rest of the
                    population
                    is Protestant, including fundamentalist and Pentecostal groups. (Evangelical groups gathered rapid
                    support from the 1990s by taking some members from the Catholic ranks; in response, Catholic groups
                    initiated a series of charismatic masses and rallies.) <br> <br>
                    Brazil has increasing numbers of adherents to Eastern Orthodoxy, Buddhism, Shintō, Islam, and other
                    religions, all of which together are about numerically equal to those practicing a form of
                    spiritualism, or spiritism, that is based on the 19th-century teachings of the French medium Allan
                    Kardec. Many Brazilians also practice syncretic religions, such as Macumba, Candomblé, Xangô, and
                    Umbanda, that blend Christian beliefs with rites imported from Africa or with spiritualistic
                    practices. Candomblé predominates in Bahia. The Nagô Candomblé sect, derived from the religion of
                    Yoruba slaves, is particularly widespread and influences the rites of other sects. Macumba and
                    Umbanda have many adherents in Rio de Janeiro state, whereas Xangô is most influential in
                    Pernambuco. Practitioners generally identify their deities with Roman Catholic saints and believe
                    that these deities intercede for them with a supreme being. Priests and priestesses are mostly of
                    African ancestry, but adherents are drawn from every ethnic group and social class, especially in
                    urban centres. Perhaps tens of millions of Brazilian Catholics occasionally participate in syncretic
                    or spiritualist feasts and ceremonies. </li>

        <h1><em>Plant and animal life</em></h1>
        <li>
            Most of the original ecosystems of the eastern highlands have been destroyed, including the once luxuriant
            hardwood forests that dominated the eastern seaboard and the formerly magnificent Paraná pine (Araucaria)
            forests that covered the southern plateaus. Monkeys, parrots, and other formerly common wildlife are now
            found only in zoos, private menageries, or small patches of forest that still support the original flora.
            Saltworks, marinas, and condominiums have replaced the former coastal waterways and swamps that once teemed
            with waterfowl and alligators. <br> <br>
            The Brazilian savannas in the semiarid Northeast have no massive herds of wild animals like their African
            counterparts. Jaguars and ocelots once inhabited the forest edges, but they have been extensively hunted by
            ranchers and are now endangered. The plant life varies considerably from coarse bunchgrasses to thorny,
            gnarled woods known as caatinga, the name derived from an Indian term meaning “white forest”; most caatinga
            are stunted, widely spaced, and intermingled with cacti. Woodlands known as agreste are found in slightly
            more humid areas. Most areas of agreste are located near the São Francisco River and on elevated slopes,
            where some remaining moisture in the air is wrung from the trade winds. Thorny trees in those regions may
            attain heights of up to 30 feet (9 metres) and form barriers with their interlocking branches that even
            leather-clad vaqueiros (“cowboys”) cannot penetrate. Artificial pastures and grain fields have largely
            replaced the native grasslands of Rio Grande do Sul. <br> <br>
            The Pantanal’s vast sloughs and watercourses support an abundance of flora and fauna, including the giant
            pirarucu, a fish that is herded into enclosures like underwater cattle pens until needed for food. Aquatic
            birds include ibis, herons, ducks, and migratory geese. There are numerous lizards and snakes, including
            deadly fer-de-lance (jararacas) and rattlesnakes. Among the larger mammals are armadillos and anteaters,
            which prey on ants and termites, whose nests may stand more than 6 feet (2 metres) high. Rheas (the South
            American relative of the ostrich), roadrunners (siriemas), and a variety of game birds, notably quail and
            partridge, are ubiquitous to the Pantanal’s higher ground and to the savannas of central Brazil. <br> <br>
            <h2>Amazonia</h2>
            <p>
                The Amazon basin has the greatest variety of plant species on Earth and an abundance of animal life, in
                contrast to the scrublands that border it to the south and east. The Amazonian region includes vast
                areas of rainforest, widely dispersed grasslands, and mangrove swamps in the tidal flats of the delta.
                Individual plants of most species tend to be widely dispersed, so that blights and other natural threats
                cause them only limited damage. A typical acre (0.4 hectare) of Amazonian forest may contain 250 or more
                tree species (in contrast, an acre of woods in the northeastern United States might have only a dozen
                species). <br> <br>
                The crowns of giant Amazonian trees form a virtually closed canopy above several lower canopy layers,
                all of which combine to allow no more than 10 percent of the sun’s rays to reach the ground below. As a
                result, more plant and animal life is found in the canopy layers than on the ground. The tallest trees
                may rise to 150–200 feet (45–60 metres) and are festooned with a wide variety of epiphytes, bromeliads,
                and lianas, while their branches teem with animal life, including insects, snakes, tree frogs, numerous
                types of monkeys, and a bewildering variety of birds. Several hundred bird species nest in the immediate
                vicinity of the main Amazon channel, and alligators, anacondas, boa constrictors, capybaras, and several
                smaller reptiles and mammals are found along the riverbanks. In the waters are manatees, freshwater
                dolphins, and some 1,500 identified species of fish, including many types of piranhas (not all of them
                flesh-eating), electric eels, and some 450 species of catfish. There may also be hundreds of
                unidentified species. <br> <br>
                The Amazon is also home to the world’s largest freshwater turtle, the yellow-headed sideneck
                (Podocnemis), which weighs an average of 150 pounds (70 kg) and is extinct everywhere else except on the
                island of Madagascar. The turtles, once a mainstay of local Indians’ diets, are now endangered, but they
                continue to be hunted illegally for their meat.

        <h1><em>Manufacturing</em></h1>
        <li>
            Manufacturing accounts for about one-fifth of the GDP and more than one-tenth of the labour force. With few
            exceptions, the Southeast contains the largest, most varied, and most efficient establishments in every
            sector of industry. It also employs three-fifths of the country’s industrial workers, who earn most of
            Brazil’s wages and produce the largest value of its goods. The South employs more than one-fifth of the
            country’s industrial workers, but the Northeast employs roughly half that number, and at lower wages than in
            the Southeast and South. Within the Southern and Southeastern states, the manufacturing sectors of Paraná,
            Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, and Espírito Santo are increasingly offsetting the
            industrial strength of São Paulo, which alone produces nearly two-fifths of Brazil’s manufactured goods.
            Generally speaking, Brazil’s factories are not large; only a few employ a hundred or more workers. As might
            be expected, the largest firms are in the Southeast, followed by the South. <br> <br>
            Since the mid-20th century Brazil has been a major world supplier of automobiles, producing nearly two
            million vehicles per year. Other major manufactures include electrical machinery, paints, soaps, medicines,
            chemicals, aircraft, steel, food products, and paper. Brazil has been a major producer of textiles,
            clothing, and footwear since the early 19th century. The textile industry began in Bahia in 1814, using
            local supplies of raw cotton; it is now centred in São Paulo and Fortaleza. The footwear industry, centred
            in Rio Grande do Sul, began in the 1820s with small leather works supplied by surplus hides from the
            meatpacking industry. <br> <br>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h1><em>Services</em></h1>
        <li>
            The rapidly expanding service sector is Brazil’s largest employer, accounting for more than half of the
            labour force. It is composed of private and government services, including national and local bureaucracies,
            public utilities, and a host of special agencies. In the private sector the largest number of workers are
            employed in hospitality industries (hotels, restaurants, and bars) and repair shops of various kinds. Retail
            sales and personal services each account for most of the rest of the private-sector workers. Employment is
            growing most rapidly in the field of information technology.
